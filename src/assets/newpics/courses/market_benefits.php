							<h2>Importance of knowing Features vs. Benefits of a product</h2>
							<p>In sales circles, there is a story often told to highlight features versus benefits. The story goes that there is a man who wants to hang a picture on his wall. In order to do that, he needs to drill a hole in the wall. He goes to his local hardware store to buy a drill. Salesman A shows the man a drill that’s shiny, compact, with 10 different drill bits, and it’s cordless. Salesman B shows the man a drill and says, “This will make a hole in your wall.” The man buys the drill from Salesman B why? </p>
							<p>In this example, the shiny, compact, 10-bit, cordless information focused on features, but failed to tap into what the man really needed.  Salesman B sold the benefit by saying the drill would deliver; a hole.  People buy solutions</p>
                            <p>
                            They have a desire or a problem and they buy the item that fulfills their need. Many business owners make the mistake of thinking buyers will understand what the feature mean in terms of results, and that’s often where their marketing falls short. In the drill example, the man might have thought a shiny compact drill was great, but what he wanted and needed was simply a hole.
                            </p>

							<h2>How to Use Features versus Benefits to Market Your Home Business</h2>
							<p>Both features and benefits are important in your marketing. Here’s how you can use them to increase your home business sales</p>
							<p><b>Understand your market:</b> If you’re market is buying something to solve a problem, you need to know what that problem is. For example, does he need a hole in the wall?</p>
                            <p><b>Determine the reason for the market’s need: </b>Many people might need your product, but not all will want it for the same reason. In our example, the man needed a hole to hang a picture, but another person may need a hole to hang a shelf or build a bookcase.( eg drinking eva water) </p>
                            <p><b>Make a list of your products or services features: </b>What are the specifications of what you offer? What are the dimensions or colors? What does it do? What additional perks come with your product or service, such as free shipping, batteries included, or free consultation?</p>
                            <p><b>Translate your features into benefits your market needs: </b>This is the key factor to creating marketing materials that entice buyers. In this part look at your features and decide how it benefits your buyer. What results will they get?</p>
                            <p><b>Consider the emotional aspect of delivering your benefit: </b>While people will consider features and benefits, ultimately, they buy on emotion. You want to tap into this emotion in your marketing materials. As you translate your features into benefits, consider how your buyer will feel when they get the results they want. Put yourself in your buyers’ shoes and imagine what it would be like for them to reap the benefits of what you offer. That’s what you want to sell.</p>
